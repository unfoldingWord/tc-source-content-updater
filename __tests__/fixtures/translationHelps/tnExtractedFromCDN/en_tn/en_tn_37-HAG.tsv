HAG	front	intro	hz6m			0		# Introduction to Haggai<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of Haggai<br><br>1. The people must finish the temple for Yahweh to bless them again (1:1–15)<br>1. This temple will be more glorious than the first temple (2:1–9)<br>1. Yahweh will bless a defiled people (2:10–19)<br>1. Yahweh will defeat the nations and establish his ruler (2:20–23)<br><br>### What is the Book of Haggai about?<br><br>The people of Israel lacked food and warm clothes. The prophet Haggai told them it was because they were not obeying Yahweh. If they would listen to him and start rebuilding the temple, then Yahweh would send rain and bless them again. The people listened and began to work on the temple. Yahweh encouraged the people, the priests, and the leaders. He told them that he was with them and would bless them.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>This book traditionally has been titled "Haggai" or "The Book of Haggai." Translators may decide to call it "The Sayings of Haggai." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Haggai?<br><br>The prophet Haggai wrote this book. He wrote it after the exiles returned from Babylon. They returned during the reign of the Persian king Darius I. Haggai probably gave all the prophesies in this book during a four-month period of time.<br><br>Very little is known about Haggai. He lived at the same time as the prophet Zechariah.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### Did Haggai prophesy before Ezra and Nehemiah?<br><br>It is likely that Haggai prophesied before the time of Ezra and Nehemiah.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What does "consider your ways" mean?<br><br>Yahweh told the people to "consider your ways" several times in this book. This means that he wants them to think carefully about how they have lived and behaved.<br>
