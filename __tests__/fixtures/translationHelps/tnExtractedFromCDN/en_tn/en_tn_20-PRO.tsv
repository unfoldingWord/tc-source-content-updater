Collection of teachings (1:8–9:18)<br>1. Proverbs of Solomon (10:1–22:16)<br>1. Words of wise men (22:17–24:22)<br>1. More words of wise men (24:23–34)<br>1. More proverbs of Solomon (25:1–29:27)<br>1. The words of Agur (30:1–33)<br>1. The words of Lemuel (31:1–9)<br>1. A good wife praised (31:10–31)<br><br>### What is the book of Proverbs about?<br><br>A proverb is a short statement that expresses some wisdom or truth. Most societies have their own proverbs. People that speak a given language can readily understand proverbs in that language.<br><br>The Book of Proverbs is a collection of proverbs. It also includes teachings about how to live wisely. Scholars refer to Proverbs, Psalms, Job, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs as wisdom literature. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>The title of this book is often translated as "Proverbs." A more general translation would be "Words for Wise People," "Words that Give Wisdom," or something similar.<br><br>### Who wrote the book of Proverbs?<br><br>Proverbs begins with the words, "The Proverbs of Solomon, son of David and King of Israel." But Solomon did not write all of the proverbs. Unnamed wise men may have written some of them. Agur the son of Jakeh (30:1) and King Lemuel (31:1) identify themselves as writing some of the proverbs.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What is meant by "wisdom" and "foolishness" in the Book of Proverbs?<br><br>"Wisdom" means the understanding and doing of what is true and morally right. A wise person understands and does what Yahweh would judge to be right. Anyone living in this way will also learn to live well with other people and to make good practical decisions in life. The book of Proverbs also acknowledges that it is important to maintain one's honor or reputation in the opinion of other people. Those who fail to live in this way are called "foolish." For this reason, it is possible for a person to be very intelligent and still be foolish. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/foolish]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What form do the individual proverbs have?<br><br>Most proverbs have two parts or two lines that are "parallel" to each other. The second part may strengthen the first, may give more details about the first, or may even say what seems the opposite of the first. Translators should take into account that each proverb is also part of a larger group of proverbs. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])<br><br>### How should personification be represented in translation?<br><br>In Proverbs, certain qualities such as wisdom and understanding are often represented as if they were wise women, as in [Proverbs 3:15-18](../03/15.md), [Proverbs 4:6-9](../04/06.md), and elsewhere. In languages where it is possible for a woman figure to represent these qualities, the translator should translate in this way. However, in many languages this kind of direct translation is not possible. In such a case, the translator may be able to translate these personifications as similes instead. This means they would present wisdom or understanding as being like a wise woman whom people should obey. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])<br>
