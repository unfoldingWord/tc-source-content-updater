Christians suffering from persecution<br>- They are worthy of the kingdom of God and of his promise of relief from trials (1:4-7)<br>- God will judge those who persecute Christians (1:8-12)<br>1. Some believers' misunderstanding about the second coming of Christ<br>- Christ's return has not yet happened (2:1-2)<br>- Instruction about the events that will precede the return of Christ (2:3-12)<br>1. Paul's confidence that God will save the Thessalonian Christians<br>- His call to "stand firm" (2:13-15)<br>- His prayer that God will comfort them (2:16-17)<br>1. Paul requests that the Thessalonian believers pray for him (3:1-5)<br>1. Paul give commands about idle believers (3:6-15)<br>1. Closing (3:16-17)<br><br>### Who wrote 2 Thessalonians?<br><br>Paul wrote 2 Thessalonians. He was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.<br><br>Paul wrote this letter while staying in the city of Corinth.<br><br>### What is the Book of 2 Thessalonians about?<br><br>Paul wrote this letter to the believers in the city of Thessalonica. He encouraged the believers because they were being persecuted. He told them to continue living in a way that pleased God. And he wanted to teach them again about Christ's return.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "2 Thessalonians" or "Second Thessalonians." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "Paul's Second Letter to the Church in Thessalonica," or "The Second Letter to the Christians in Thessalonica." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What is the "second coming" of Jesus?<br><br>Paul wrote much in this letter about Jesus' eventual return to Earth. When Jesus returns, he will judge all mankind. He will also rule over creation. And he will cause there to be peace everywhere. Paul also explained that a "man of lawlessness" will come before Christ's return. This person will obey Satan and cause many people to oppose God. But Jesus will destroy this person when he returns.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What did Paul mean by the expression "in Christ," "in the Lord," etc.?<br><br>Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 2 Thessalonians?<br><br>For the following verses, modern versions of the Bible differ from older versions. The ULT text has the modern reading and puts the older reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider using the reading found in those versions. If not, translators are advised to follow the modern reading.<br><br>* "and the man of lawlessness is revealed" (2:3). The ULT, UST, and most modern versions read this way. Older versions have, "and the man of sin is revealed."<br>* "For God chose you as the firstfruits for salvation" (2:13) The ULT, UST, and some other versions read this way. Other versions have, "For God chose you from the first for salvation."<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])<br>
2TH	1	intro	m987			0		# 2 Thessalonians 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Verses 1-2 formally introduce this letter. Letters in the ancient Near East commonly had introductions of this type.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. A paradox occurs in verses 4-5: "We talk about your patience and faith in all your persecutions. We talk about the afflictions that you endure. This is a sign of God's righteous judgment." People would not normally think that believing in God while being persecuted is a sign of God's righteous judgment. But in verses 5-10, Paul explains how God will reward those who believe in him and how he will judge those who afflict them. ([2 Thessalonians 1:4-5](./04.md))
