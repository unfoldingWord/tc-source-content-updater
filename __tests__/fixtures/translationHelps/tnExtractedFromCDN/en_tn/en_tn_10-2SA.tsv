2SA	front	intro	bs9v			0		# Introduction to 2 Samuel<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of 2 Samuel<br><br>1. The first years of David's reign (1:1–7:29)<br>- Saul is killed; David is kind to Ishbosheth (1:1–4:12)<br>- David defeats the Philistines (5:1–25)<br>- Victories, the ark, the house of God (6:1–7:29)<br>1. David extends his rule to all the Promised Land (8:1–10:19)<br>1. David's sin with Bathsheba (11:1–12:31)<br>1. Amnon and Tamar; Absalom kills Amnon (13:1–14:33)<br>1. The later years of David's reign (15:1–24:25)<br>- Absalom rebels and is killed (15:1–18:33)<br>- David's kingdom restored (19:1–20:26)<br>- Famine and warfare (21:1–14)<br>- David's song of praise (22:1–23:7)<br>- David's mighty men (23:8–39)<br>- Yahweh judges David's sin of numbering the people; the plague stopped (24:1–25)<br><br>### What is the Book of 2 Samuel about?<br><br>This book is about David ruling as king over Israel. He first ruled over the tribe of Judah for seven years. Then the other eleven tribes agreed to have him become their king. He ruled over all Israel for thirty-three years.<br><br>Throughout this time, David led his army to fight foreign enemies who attacked Israel. However, he struggled the most against someone in his own family. Absalom, his son, rebelled and fought against him ([2 Samuel 13-19](../13/01.md)).<br><br>The Book of 2 Samuel also tells about when David sinned greatly. He slept with Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite. When she became pregnant, David arranged for Uriah to be killed in battle. David and all Israel suffered much because of David's sin.  However, the writer also tells of Yahweh repeatedly showing David grace and love after David repented of his sin.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators can use the traditional title "2 Samuel," or "Second Samuel." Or translators may consider a clearer title such as "The Second Book about Samuel, Saul, and David." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### What was the purpose of the Book of 2 Samuel?<br><br>The Book of 2 Samuel begins where 1 Samuel ended. The writer continues to show how the tribes of Israel unite under the first kings of Israel. The Book of 2 Samuel centers around David as the king Yahweh chose to lead Israel.<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of 2 Samuel?<br><br>It is uncertain who wrote 2 Samuel. It may have been someone alive soon after King Solomon died. When Solomon died, the kingdom of Israel split into two kingdoms. The author probably lived in the southern kingdom of Judah. A descendant of David continued to rule over the southern kingdom. The author may have written 2 Samuel to defend David's right to be king. This would prove that David's descendant was the rightful king of God's people.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What covenant had its beginning in the Book of 2 Samuel?<br><br>In 2 Samuel 7, Yahweh made a covenant with David. God promised to make a descendant of David rule forever over Israel. Christians believe that Jesus Christ fulfills this covenant. Jesus was a descendant of David. Jesus is the true "anointed one," the person God chose to be king forever. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### Why does the book refer to someone being addressed indirectly?<br><br>David frequently refers to himself as "your servant" when he speaks to King Saul. He also calls Saul "my master." Indirectly addressing a person in this way can be difficult to translate. It is intended to show that the speaker submits to the one being addressed. English sometimes uses the address "sir" or "ma'am" in this way.<br><br>### Can I translate this book before 1 Samuel?<br><br>The Book of 1 Samuel should be translated before 2 Samuel, since 2 Samuel continues from where 1 Samuel ends.<br><br>### How is the name "Israel" used in the Bible?<br><br>The name "Israel" is used in many different ways in the Bible. Jacob was the son of Isaac. God changed his name to Israel. The descendants of Jacob became a nation also called Israel. Eventually, the nation of Israel split into two kingdoms. The northern kingdom was named Israel. The southern kingdom was named Judah. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/israel]])<br><br>2 Samuel speaks of both the northern kingdom of Israel and the whole nation of Israel as "Israel." However, these references appear in the narrative long before the two kingdoms split apart. It seems clear that the references to Israel and Judah indicate that the author wrote 2 Samuel at a time after the kingdoms split. (See: [2 Samuel 2:10](../02/10.md); [2 Samuel 3:10](../03/10.md); [2 Samuel 5:5](../05/05.md); [2 Samuel 11:11](../11/11.md); [2 Samuel 12:8](../12/08.md); [2 Samuel 19:42-43](../19/42.md); [2 Samuel 21:2](../21/02.md); [2 Samuel 24:1](../24/01.md)).<br>
