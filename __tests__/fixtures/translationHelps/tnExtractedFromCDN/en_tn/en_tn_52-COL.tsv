The person and work of Christ<br>- Deliverance and redemption (1:13-14)<br>- Christ: the Image of the invisible God, and the One who is over all creation (1:15-17)<br>- Christ is the Head of the Church, and the Church trusts in him (1:18-2:7)<br>1. Tests of faithfulness<br>- Warnings against false teachers (2:8-19)<br>- True godliness is not rigid rules and unbending traditions (2:20-23)<br>1. Teaching and living<br>- Life in Christ (3:1-4)<br>- Old and new life (3:5-17)<br>- Christian family (3:18-4:1)<br>1. Christian behavior (4:2-6)<br>1. Closing and greetings<br>- Paul thanks Tychicus and Onesimus (4:7-9)<br>- Paul sends greetings from his associates (4:10-14)<br>- Paul gives directions to Archippus and the Christians in Laodicea (4:15-17)<br>- Paul's personal greeting (4:18)<br><br>#### Who wrote the Book of Colossians?<br><br>Paul wrote the Book of Colossians. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.<br><br>Paul wrote this letter while in prison in Rome.<br><br>#### What is the Book of Colossians about?<br><br>Paul wrote this letter to the believers in the Asia Minor city of Colossae. The main purpose of this letter was to defend the gospel against false teachers. He did this by praising Jesus as the image of God, sustainer of all things, and head of the church. Paul wanted them to understand that only Christ is needed for God to accept them.<br><br>#### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "Colossians." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "Paul's Letter to the Church in Colossae," or "A Letter to the Christians in Colossae." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>#### What were the religious issues that the church in Colossae struggled with?<br><br>In the church in Colossae, there were false teachers. Their exact teaching is unknown. But they probably taught their followers to worship angels and to obey strict rules about religious ceremonies. They probably also taught that a person must be circumcised and can only eat certain types of food. Paul said these false teachings came from the minds of men and not from God.<br><br>#### How did Paul use the imagery of heaven and earth?<br><br>In this letter, Paul frequently spoke of heaven as "above." He distinguished it from the earth, which Scripture speaks of as being "below." The purpose of this imagery was to teach Christians to live in a way that honors God who lives in heaven above. Paul is not teaching that the earth or the physical world is evil. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>#### How are the ideas of "holy" and "sanctify" represented in Colossians in the ULT?<br><br>The scriptures use such words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In Colossians, these words usually indicate a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. So Colossians in the ULT uses "believers" or "those who believe in him." (See: 1:2, 12, 26)<br><br>#### Was Jesus created or is he eternal?<br><br>Jesus was not a created being but has always existed as God. Jesus also became a human being. There is potential for confusion in Colossians 1:15 where it says Jesus "is the firstborn of all creation." This statement means that Jesus is dominant over all of creation. It does not mean that he was the first thing God created. Translators should be careful not to imply that Jesus is a created being.<br><br>#### What does Paul mean by the expression "in Christ," "in the Lord," etc.?<br><br>Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. See the introduction to the book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.<br><br>#### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Colossians?<br><br>For the following verses, some modern versions of the Bible differ from older versions. The ULT text has the modern reading and puts the older reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider using the reading found in those versions. If not, translators are advised to follow the modern reading.<br><br>* "May grace be to you, and peace from God our Father" (1:2). Some older versions have a longer reading: "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."<br>* "Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf" (1:7). Some older versions read "for you": "Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, a faithful servant of Christ for you."<br>* "the Father, who has made you able to have a share in the inheritance of the believers in light" (1:12). Some older versions read, "the Father, who has qualified us for a share in the inheritance in light."<br>* "In his Son we have redemption" (1:14). Some older versions read, "In his Son we have redemption through his blood."<br>* "and forgave us all of our trespasses" (2:13). Some older versions read: "and forgave you all of your trespasses."<br>* "When Christ appears, who is your life" (3:4). Some older versions read, "When Christ appears, who is our life."<br>* "It is for these things that the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience" (3:6). The ULT, UST, and many other modern versions read this way. However, some modern and older versions read, "It is for these things that the wrath of God is coming."<br>* "I sent him to you for this, that you might know the matters about us" (4:8). Some older versions read, "I sent him to you for this, that he might know the matters about you."<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])<br>
COL	1	intro	gtm3			0		# Colossians 01 General Notes<br>#### Structure and formatting<br><br>As in a typical letter, Paul begins his letter in verses 1-2 by introducing Timothy and himself to the Christians in Colossae.<br><br>Paul writes much of this chapter around two subjects: who Christ is, and what Christ has done for the Christian.<br><br>#### Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>##### Secret truth<br><br>Paul refers to a "secret truth" in this chapter. The role of the church in the plans of God was once unknown. But God has now revealed it. Part of this involves the Gentiles having equal standing with the Jews in the plans of God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]])<br><br>#### Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>##### Images for Christian living<br>Paul uses many different images to describe Christian living. In this chapter, he uses the images of "walking" and "bearing fruit." (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fruit]])<br><br>#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>##### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Verse 24 is a paradox: "Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you." People do not usually rejoice when they suffer. But in verses 25-29 Paul explains why his suffering is good. ([Colossians 1:24](../../col/01/24.md))<br>
COL	1	1	h5gl	figs-inclusive		0	General Information:	Though this letter is from Paul and Timothy to the Colossian believers, later in the letter Paul makes it clear that he is the writer.

The words "you," "your," and "yours" refer to the Colossian believers and so are plural unless noted otherwise.

He may be acknowledging here that there is much suffering that he and all other Christians must endure before Christ comes again, and that Christ in a spiritual sense joins with them in experiencing these hardships.

COL	2	intro	p3uc			0		# Colossians 02 General Notes<br>#### Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>##### Circumcision and baptism<br>In verses 11-12, Paul uses both the old covenant sign of circumcision and the new covenant sign of baptism to show how Christians are united with Christ and freed from sin.<br><br>#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>##### Flesh<br><br>This is a complex issue. "Flesh" is possibly a metaphor for our sinful nature. Paul is not teaching that the physical part of man is sinful. Paul appears to be teaching that, while Christians are alive ("in the flesh"), we will continue to sin. But our new nature will be fighting against our old nature. Paul also uses "flesh" in this chapter to refer to the physical body.<br><br>##### Implicit information<br>Paul mentions several issues in this chapter that imply information about the context of the church in Colossae. It is best to allow the text to remain uncertain over the actual details. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br>
COL	2	1	tt6v			0	Connecting Statement:	Paul continues to encourage the believers in Colossae and Laodicea to understand that Christ is God and that he lives in believers, so they should live in the same way they received him.
