Solomon reigns (3:1–11:43)<br>- Solomon becomes wise and wealthy (3:1–4:43)<br>- Solomon's temple (5:1–8:66)<br>- Rise and fall of Solomon (9:1–11:43)<br>1. The kingdom divides (12:1-14:31)<br>- Rehoboam succeeds Solomon (12:1–24)<br>- Jeroboam rules the northern kingdom of Israel (12:25–33)<br>- Ahijah prophesies against Jeroboam (13:1–14:20)<br>- Rehoboam's end (14:21–31)<br>1. Kings and events in Israel and Judah (15:1-22:53)<br>- Abijah and Asa in Judah (15:1–24)<br>- Nadab in Israel (15:25–32)<br>- Baasha in Israel (15:33–16:7)<br>- Elah in Israel (16:8–14)<br>- Zimri in Israel (16:15–22)<br>- Omri in Israel (16:23–28)<br>- Ahab in Israel (16:29–22:40)<br>- Jehoshaphat in Judah (22:41–50)<br>- Ahaziah in Israel (22:51–53)<br><br>### What are the Books of 1 and 2 Kings about?<br><br>These books are about what happened to the people of Israel, from the time of King Solomon to the time both the northern and southern kingdoms were destroyed. These books describe how Israel split into two kingdoms after Solomon died. It also tells about all the kings that ruled over each kingdom after Solomon died.<br><br>In the southern kingdom, some kings did what Yahweh judged to be right. For example, King Josiah repaired the temple and reformed the worship of Yahweh. He responded to the high priest finding a copy of the Law of Yahweh in Jerusalem ([2 Kings 22–23](../../2ki/22/01.md)). However, all of the kings of the northern kingdom were wicked.<br><br>The Assyrians destroyed the northern kingdom in 722 B.C. The Babylonians destroyed the southern kingdom in 586 B.C.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>The Books of 1 and 2 Kings were originally one book in Hebrew. They were separated into two books when translated into Greek. Translators might choose more meaningful titles such as "The First Book about the Kings" and "The Second Book about the Kings." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What was the purpose of 1 and 2 Kings?<br><br>These books were probably finished during the exile, after the Babylonians had destroyed the temple. They show how being faithful to Yahweh results in his blessing and prospering his people. Worshipping idols and not being faithful result in their being punished and destroyed.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### Why do the Books of 1 and 2 Kings refer to someone being addressed indirectly?<br><br>In the Bible, people often referred to themselves as "your servant" when speaking to anyone in a superior position to themselves. Indirectly addressing people in this way was intended to honor the one addressed. English sometimes uses the address "sir" in this way. But a translator should use whatever expressions that are natural in the project language in order to honor someone in a superior position.<br><br>### What does the king "did what was right (or evil) in the eyes of Yahweh" mean?<br><br>The writer repeats this kind of expression throughout the Books of 1 and 2 Kings. Here "in the eyes of Yahweh" represents what Yahweh thinks about someone. If a king was faithful and obeyed the covenant, he did what was right according to Yahweh. If he was not faithful and disobeyed the covenant, he did what was evil according to Yahweh.<br><br>### What is the meaning of the term "Israel"?<br><br>The name "Israel" is used in many different ways in the Bible. Jacob was the son of Isaac. God changed his name to Israel. The descendants of Jacob became a nation also called Israel. Eventually, the nation of Israel split into two kingdoms. The northern kingdom was named Israel. The southern kingdom was named Judah. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/israel]])<br><br>### Can I translate the Book of 1 Kings before I translate the Books of 1 and 2 Samuel?<br><br>The Books of 1 and 2 Samuel should be translated before 1 Kings, since 1 Kings continues from where 2 Samuel ends.<br>
1KI	1	intro	v496			0		# 1 Kings 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1 Kings is a continuation of 2 Samuel.<br><br>This chapter records the beginning of the reign of Solomon (chapters 1-11) after the death of David.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>== The next king ==<br>David did not announce who was to succeed him. Because of this, there was fighting between David's sons over who should be king. Adonijah invited guests to a banquet and declared himself king. Then those favoring Solomon told David and he declared Solomon the new king.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Idiom<br>Several times in this chapter, the people use the idiom "sit on the throne" to mean "be king." Solomon assures Adonijah that if he behaves himself "not a hair of his will fall to the earth," meaning "he will not be harmed." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])<br>

The bronze objects were made by hollowing out the shape of the object in clay and then pouring in the hot melted liquid bronze and letting it cool. He made two large pillars and a large water reservoir set on the backs of 12 bronze cows. He made all the instruments for use in the sacrifices outside the temple. He made the furnishing inside the temple out of gold.<br><br>### The temple and the palace<br>Solomon spent 13 years building a palace for himself that was much bigger than the temple.

This is sometimes called a "civil war."<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Israel splits<br>God's warning to Solomon came true. In spite of his famous wealth, Solomon had over-taxed his own people and forced them to work for free. When the people requested that King Rehoboam reduce taxes and forced labor, he said that he would be harsher than his father. This caused the 10 northern tribes to revolt and appoint Jeroboam as their king. These northern tribes are now called the kingdom of Israel. Only Judah and Benjamin stayed with Rehoboam. They are called Judah. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/appoint]])<br><br>### Jeroboam introduces calf worship<br>Jeroboam made a terrible mistake. He was afraid that if the people continued to go to Jerusalem to worship in the temple, they would want to return to Rehoboam as their king. So he made two shrines with calves made of gold for the people to worship. This eventually caused the destruction of his whole family. The kingdom of Israel continued worshiping the idols until they were taken slaves by the Assyrians. The northern tribes were unable to truly worship Yahweh without going to Jerusalem in the kingdom of Judah.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metaphor<br>The people used the metaphor of "yoke" for oppressive government:  "Your father made our yoke difficult. Now then, make your father's hard work easier, and lighten the heavy yoke that he put on us." But Rehoboam promised to increase their oppression with three metaphors: "My little finger is thicker than my father's waist. So now, although my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father punished you with whips, but I will punish you with scorpions."

Elijah went to meet Ahab. He told Ahab to bring the 450 prophets of Baal and all the people to Mount Carmel.  Then he proposed an experiment, which was carried out. The prophets of Baal took one bull, killed them, cut them up, and placed them on wood on an altar without lighting the fire. The prophets of Baal danced and prayed to Baal all morning and half the afternoon. After they were exhausted, Elijah built his altar and drenched it with water. Then he prayed. God answered his prayer with fire that burned up the sacrifice, the altar and the water. Then Elijah told the people to seize the prophets of Baal and kill them. After that, Elijah prayed for rain, and it rained very hard. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br>### Humor<br><br>Elijah insults the false god Baal. He states, "Perhaps he is thinking, or is relieving himself, or he is traveling on a journey, or perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened."
