ACT	front	intro	mw28			0		# Introduction to Acts<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of Acts<br><br>1. The beginning of the church and its mission (1:1–2:41)<br>1. The early church in Jerusalem (2:42–6:7)<br>1. Increasing opposition and the martyrdom of Steven (6:8–7:60)<br>1. The persecution of the church and Philip's ministry (8:1–40)<br>1. Paul becomes an apostle (9:1–31)<br>1. The ministry of Peter and the first Gentile converts (9:32–12:24)<br>1. Paul, the apostle to Gentiles, the Jewish law, and council of church leaders at Jerusalem (12:25–16:5)<br>1. The expansion of the church into the middle Mediterranean area and Asia Minor (16:6–19:20)<br>1. Paul travels to Jerusalem and becomes a prisoner in Rome (19:21–28:31)<br><br>### What is the Book of Acts about?<br><br>The Book of Acts tells the story of the early church as more and more people became believers. It shows the power of the the Holy Spirit helping the early Christians. The events in this book began when Jesus went back to heaven and ended about thirty years later.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "The Acts of the Apostles." Or translators may choose a title that may be clearer, for example, "The Acts of the Holy Spirit through the Apostles."<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Acts?<br><br>This book does not give the name of the author. However, it is addressed to Theophilus, the same person to whom the Gospel of Luke is addressed. Also, in parts of the book, the author uses the word "we." This indicates that the author traveled with Paul. Most scholars think that Luke was this person traveling with Paul. Therefore, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought Luke is the author of the Book of Acts as well as the Gospel of Luke.<br><br>Luke was a medical doctor. His way of writing shows that he was an educated man. He was probably a Gentile. He saw many of the events described in the Book of Acts.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What is the Church?<br><br>The Church is the group of people who believe in Christ. The Church includes both Jew and Gentile believers. The events in this book show God helping the Church. He empowered believers to live righteous lives through his Holy Spirit.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Acts?<br><br>These are the most significant textual issues in Acts:<br><br>The following verses are found in older versions of the Bible, but they are not in the best ancient copies of the Bible. Some modern versions put the verses in square brackets ([]). The ULT and UST put them in a footnote.<br><br>* "Philip said, 'If you believe with all your heart, you may be baptized.' The Ethiopian answered, 'I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God'" (Acts 8:37).<br>* "But it seemed good to Silas to remain there." (Acts 15:34)<br>* "And we wanted to judge him according to our law. But Lysias, the officer, came and forcibly took him out of our hands, sending him to you." (Acts 24:6b-8a)<br>* "When he had said these things, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves." (Acts 28:29)<br><br>In the following verses, it is uncertain what the original text said. Translators will need to choose which reading to translate. The ULT has the first readings but include the second readings in footnotes.<br>* "They returned from Jerusalem" (Acts 12:25). Some versions read, "They returned to Jerusalem (or to there)."<br>* "he put up with them" (Acts 13:18). Some versions read, "he cared for them."<br>* "This is what the Lord says, who has done these things that have been known from ancient times." (Acts 15:17-18). Some older versions read, "This is what the Lord says, to whom are known all his deeds from ancient times."<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])<br>
ACT	1	intro	vyg9			0		# Acts 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter records an event, commonly known as the "Ascension," when Jesus returned to heaven after he became alive again. He will not come back until he returns at his "second coming." (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/resurrection]])<br><br>The UST has set the words "Dear Theophilus" apart from the other words. This is because English speakers often start letters this way. You might want to start this book the way people start letters in your culture.<br><br>Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the two quotes from Psalms in 1:20.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Baptize<br><br>The word "baptize" has two meanings in this chapter. It refers to the water baptism of John and to the baptism of the Holy Spirit ([Acts 1:5](../../act/01/05.md)). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/baptize]])<br><br>### "He spoke about the kingdom of God"<br><br>Some scholars believe that when Jesus "spoke about the kingdom of God," he explained to the disciples why the kingdom of God did not come before he died. Others believe that the kingdom of God did begin while Jesus was alive and that here Jesus was explaining that it was beginning in a new form.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### The twelve disciples<br><br>The following are the lists of the twelve disciples:<br><br>In Matthew:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>In Mark:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James the son of Zebedee and John the son of Zebedee (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder), Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>In Luke:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon (who was called the Zealot), Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>Thaddaeus is probably the same person as Jude, the son of James.<br><br>### Akeldama<br><br>This is a phrase in Hebrew or Aramaic. Luke used Greek letters so his readers would know how it sounded, and then he told what it means. You should probably spell it the way it sounds in your language and then explain the meaning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])<br>

Luke also uses the word "tongues" to describe the languages that the people spoke after the Holy Spirit filled them ([Acts 2:4](../02/04.md)).<br><br>### Last days<br><br>No one knows for sure when the "last days" ([Acts 2:17](../../act/02/17.md)) began. Your translation should not say more than the ULT does about this. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lastday]])<br><br>### Baptize<br><br>The word "baptize" in this chapter refers to Christian baptism ([Acts 2:38-41](../02/38.md)). Though the event described in [Acts 2:1-11](./01.md) is the baptism of the Holy Spirit that Jesus promised in [Acts 1:5](../../act/01/05.md), the word "baptize" here does not refer to that event. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/baptize]])<br><br>### The prophecy of Joel<br><br>Many of the things that Joel said would happen did happen on the day of Pentecost ([Acts 2:17-18](../02/17.md)), but some things Joel spoke of did not happen ([Acts 2:19-20](../02/19.md)). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])<br><br>### Wonders and signs<br><br>These words refer to things that only God could do that showed that Jesus is who the disciples said he is.<br>

ACT	4	intro	pv3a			0		# Acts 04 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 4:25-26.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Unity<br><br>The first Christians wanted very much to be united. They wanted to believe the same things and share everything they owned and help those who needed help.<br><br>### "Signs and wonders"<br><br>This phrase refers to things that only God can do. The Christians wanted God to do what only he can do so that people would believe that what they said about Jesus was true.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Cornerstone<br><br>The cornerstone was the first piece of stone that people put down when they were building a building. This is a metaphor for the most important part of something, the part on which everything depends.

All of them had been raised as Jews, but some of them had lived in Judea and spoke Hebrew, and others had lived in Gentile areas and spoke Greek. Those who gave out the food gave it to the Hebrew-speaking widows but not to the Greek-speaking widows.

ACT	7	intro	p9h4			0		# Acts 07 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 7:42-43 and 49-50.<br><br>It appears that 8:1 is part of the narrative of this chapter.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### "Stephen said"<br><br>Stephen told the history of Israel very briefly. He paid special attention to the times that the Israelites had rejected the people God had chosen to lead them. At the end of the story, he said that the Jewish leaders he was talking to had rejected Jesus just as the evil Israelites had always rejected the leaders God had appointed for them.<br><br>### "Full of the Holy Spirit"<br><br>The Holy Spirit completely controlled Stephen so that he said only and all of what God wanted him to say.<br><br>### Foreshadowing<br><br>When an author speaks of something that is not important at that time but will be important later in the story, this is called foreshadowing. Luke mentions Saul, also known as Paul, here, even though he is not an important person in this part of the story. This is because Paul is an important person in the rest of the Book of Acts.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Implied information<br><br>Stephen was talking to Jews who knew the law of Moses well, so he did not explain things that his hearers already knew. But you may need to explain some of these things so that your readers will be able to understand what Stephen was saying. For example, you may need to make explicit that when Joseph's brothers "sold him into Egypt" ([Acts 7:9](../../act/07/09.md)), Joseph was going to be a slave in Egypt. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>### Metonymy<br><br>Stephen spoke of Joseph ruling "over Egypt" and over all of Pharaoh's household. By this he meant that Joseph ruled over the people of Egypt and of the people and possessions in Pharaoh's household. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Background knowledge<br><br>The Jewish leaders to whom Stephen spoke already knew much about the events he was telling them about. They knew what Moses had written in the Book of Genesis. If the Book of Genesis has not been translated into your language, it may be difficult for your readers to understand what Stephen said.<br>

ACT	9	intro	jm6x			0		# Acts 09 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### "The Way"<br><br>No one knows for sure who first started calling believers "followers of the Way." This is probably what the believers called themselves, because the Bible often speaks of a person living his life as if that person were walking on a path or "way." If this is true, the believers were "following the way of the Lord" by living in a way that pleased God.<br><br>### "Letters for the synagogues in Damascus"<br><br>The "letters" Paul asked for were probably legal papers that permitted him to put Christians in prison. The synagogue leaders in Damascus would have obeyed the letter because it was written by the high priest. If the Romans had seen the letter, they also would have allowed Saul to persecute the Christians, because they permitted the Jews to do as they desired to people who broke their religious laws.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### What Saul saw when he met Jesus<br><br>It is clear that Saul saw a light and that it was because of this light that he "fell upon the ground." Some people think that Saul knew that it was the Lord speaking to him without seeing a human form, because the Bible often speaks of God as being light and living in light. Other people think that later in his life he was able to say, "I have seen the Lord Jesus" because it was a human form that he saw here.<br>

The law of Moses did say that some foods were unclean, but it did not say that God's people could not visit or eat with Gentiles. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>### Baptism and the Holy Spirit<br><br>The Holy Spirit "fell on" those who were listening to Peter.

ACT	16	intro	e7z2			0		# Acts 16 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Timothy's circumcision<br><br>Paul circumcised Timothy because they were telling the message of Jesus to Jews and Gentiles. Paul wanted the Jews to know that he respected the law of Moses even though the church leaders in Jerusalem had decided that Christians did not need to be circumcised..<br><br>### The woman who had a spirit of divination<br><br>Most people want very much to know the future, but the law of Moses said that speaking with the spirits of dead people to learn about the future is a sin. This woman seems to have been able to tell the future very well. She was a slave, and her masters made much money from her work. Paul wanted her to stop sinning, so he told the spirit to leave her.

ACT	21	intro	gh1j			0		# Acts 21 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Acts 21:1-19 describes Paul's journey to Jerusalem. After he arrived in Jerusalem, the believers there told him that the Jews wanted to harm him and what he should do so they would not harm him (verses 20-26). Even though Paul did what the believers told him to do, the Jews tried to kill him. The Romans rescued him and gave him a chance to speak to the Jews.<br><br>The last verse of the chapter ends with an incomplete sentence. Most translations leave the sentence incomplete, as the ULT does.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### "They are all determined to keep the law"<br><br>The Jews in Jerusalem were following the law of Moses. Even those who were following Jesus still kept the law. Both groups thought that Paul had been telling Jews in Greece not to keep the law. But it was only the Gentiles to whom Paul was saying that.<br><br>### Nazarite vow<br>The vow that Paul and his three friends made was probably a Nazarite vow, because they shaved their heads ([Acts 21:23](../../act/21/23.md)).<br><br>### Gentiles in the temple<br><br>The Jews accused Paul of bringing a Gentile man into a part of the temple into which God only allowed Jews to go. They thought that God wanted them to punish Paul by killing him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])<br><br>### Roman citizenship<br><br>The Romans thought that they needed to treat only Roman citizens justly. They could do as they desired with people who were not Roman citizens, but they had to obey the law with other Romans. Some people were born Roman citizens, and others gave money to the Roman government so they could become Roman citizens.<br>

ACT	22	intro	gq5g			0		# Acts 22 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This is the second account of Paul's conversion in the book of Acts. Because this is such an important event in the early church, there are three accounts of Paul's conversion. (See: [Acts 9](../09/01.md) and [Acts 26](../26/01.md))<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### "In the Hebrew language"<br><br>Most Jews at this time spoke Aramaic and Greek. Most of the people who spoke Hebrew were educated Jewish scholars. This is why the people paid attention when Paul started speaking in Hebrew.<br><br>### "The Way"<br><br>No one knows for sure who first started calling believers "followers of the Way." This is probably what the believers called themselves, because the Bible often speaks of a person living his life as if that person were walking on a path or "way." If this is true, the believers were "following the way of the Lord" by living in a way that pleased God.<br><br>### Roman citizenship<br><br>The Romans thought that they needed to treat only Roman citizens justly. They could do as they desired with people who were not Roman citizens, but they had to obey the law with other Romans. Some people were born Roman citizens, and others gave money to the Roman government so they could become Roman citizens. The "chief captain" could have been punished for treating a Roman citizen the same way he would treat a non-citizen.<br>
