1SA	front	intro	z2ar			0		# Introduction to 1 Samuel<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of 1 Samuel<br><br>1. Samuel as judge over Israel (1:1–7:17)<br>- Samuel as a child (1:1–3:21)<br>- Shiloh priesthood; the fall and death of Eli the priest (4:1–22)<br>- The ark of God and the war with the Philistines (5:1–6:21)<br>- Mizpah; Samuel's rule over Israel (7:1–17)<br>1. Saul and Samuel (8:1–15:35)<br>- Samuel lets the people seek a king (8:1–22)<br>- Saul anointed king (9:1–10:27)<br>- Battle and victory over the Ammonites (11:1–15)<br>- Samuel's farewell (12:1–25)<br>- Saul's weakness and failures (13:1–15:35)<br>1. David and his conflicts with Saul (16:1–31:13)<br>- God's choice of David to be king (16:1–23)<br>- David fights Goliath (17:1–58)<br>- Saul's jealousy of David; David and Jonathan (18:1–20:42)<br>- David in the wilderness; David in Philistia (21:1–30:31)<br>- Death of Saul (31:1–13)<br><br>### What is the Book of 1 Samuel about?<br><br>The Book of 1 Samuel is about Samuel, Saul, and David. Samuel was the last of the judges over Israel. Saul was the first king of Israel. Much of the book is about how Saul became king, then how he later sinned against God and died. God chose David to be king after Saul. This book shows how God protected David when Saul tried to kill him.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators can use the traditional title "1 Samuel" or "First Samuel." Or, translators may consider a clearer title such as "The First Book About Samuel, Saul, and David." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### What is the purpose of the Book of 1 Samuel?<br><br>The purpose of 1 Samuel is to give an account of the events leading up to David becoming king of Israel.  In 1 Samuel, the twelve tribes of Israel unite under the first king of Israel, Saul. But Saul does not obey Yahweh's commands. So God uses Samuel to choose David as a king who will trust and obey Yahweh.<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of 1 Samuel?<br><br>It is uncertain who wrote 1 Samuel. It may have been someone alive soon after King Solomon died. When Solomon died, the kingdom of Israel split into two kingdoms. The author probably lived in the southern kingdom of Judah. A descendant of David continued to rule over the southern kingdom. The author may have written 1 Samuel to defend David's right to be king. This would prove that David's descendant was the rightful king of God's people.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### Who is "Yahweh's anointed"?<br><br>The writer of 1 Samuel often speaks of "Yahweh's anointed." This refers to the one whom Yahweh chose to be the king of his people. Also, the phrase "Yahweh's anointed" would make later readers think about the future descendant of David who would become king of God's people. This person who Yahweh chose would be known as the Messiah. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/anoint]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What are curses, as found in 1 Samuel and elsewhere?<br><br>A curse is a strong statement a person makes to cause bad things to happen to the person or thing being cursed. A curse usually has this pattern: "May God do so to you, and even more, if you hide anything from me of all the words that he spoke to you" (1 Sam. 3:17). Other instances of curses in 1 and 2 Samuel are found in 1 Sam 14:44; 20:13; 25:22; 2 Sam 3:9, 35; and 19:13. The translator should represent a curse in the project language in as strong a way as possible.<br><br>### How is the name "Israel" used in the Bible?<br><br>The name "Israel" is used in many different ways in the Bible. Jacob was the son of Isaac. God changed his name to Israel. The descendants of Jacob became a nation also called Israel. Eventually, the nation of Israel split into two kingdoms. The northern kingdom was named Israel. The southern kingdom was named Judah. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/israel]])<br><br>The Book of 1 Samuel has two references to Israel and Judah ([1 Samuel 17:52](../17/52.md), [1 Samuel 18:16](../18/16.md)). However, these references appear in the text long before the two kingdoms split apart. It seems clear that the references to Israel and Judah are in the text because the author wrote at a time after the kingdoms split. He wanted the readers to understand that all the twelve tribes had supported David.<br><br>### What is the meaning of the phrase "to this day"?<br><br>This phrase was used by the narrator to refer to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that "to this day" refers to a time already passed. He must avoid giving the impression that the present day of the translation's readers is meant. The translator might decide to say, "to this day, at the time when this is being written" or "to this day, at the time of writing." This phrase occurs in 1 Samuel 5:5; 6:18: 27:6; 30:25.<br>
1SA	1	intro	cj3l			0		# 1 Samuel 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter introduces Samuel. It is the beginning of the section 1 Samuel 1-7 which tells about Samuel, the religious leader of Israel.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Two wives<br>This was a common practice in the ancient Near East. It was against the law of Moses. The men of Israel would have sinned if they married more than one woman. This type of marriage always creates problems because of jealousy. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/jealous]])<br><br>### "Pay his vow"<br>It was customary for Israelites to promise God to make a sacrifice to him if God answered special prayers. Making such a sacrifice was called paying one's vow. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/vow]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Idioms<br><br>When Hannah wanted to assure Eli she was telling the truth, she used the idiom "as you live." This is a type of oath formula meaning "I promise you I am telling the truth." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])<br><br>The author also uses the phrase "call to mind." This is a common idiom meaning "remember."<br>

1SA	2	intro	fe7v			0		# 1 Samuel 02 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read.

They were ungodly priests who continually sinned and did not honor God. Eli corrected them but they did not listen. A prophet warned Eli that God would stop his family from being priests and his sons would both die on the same day. At the same time, Samuel was growing up and serving God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>This chapter has many figures of speech because the first part of the chapter is a song and the last part of the chapter is a prophecy.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>### Rhetorical questions<br><br>God used three rhetorical questions to correct and condemn Eli. "Did I not reveal myself to the house of your ancestor, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh's house?" "Why then do you scorn my offerings that I required in the place where I live?" "Why do you honor your sons above me by making yourselves fat with the best of every offering of my people Israel?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br>

As Samuel grew up, God gave him many messages. People came from all over Israel to find out what God had to say.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metonymy<br><br>In order to show respect when talking to God, Samuel calls himself "your servant" when referring to himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])<br><br>### Idioms<br><br>One characteristic of prophecy is the use of figures of speech. In this passage there are two idioms: "ears will shake," meaning "will shock everyone who hears" and "carry out," meaning "do." (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])<br><br>In order to be sure Samuel would tell him the whole truth, Eli used the standard formula for a curse: "may God do to you, and even more, if," meaning "God will punish severely if the person does what the curse says he will do."

It recounts two battles between Israel and the Philistines. In both battles, Israel was badly defeated and, in the second, the Ark was captured.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The Ark is captured<br><br>The Philistine army invaded Israel, and Israel's army went to fight them but was defeated. Israel decided that if they took the Ark into the next battle, God would cause them to win. When Eli's sons took the Ark into the next battle and the Philistines won the battle, they killed Eli's two sons and captured the Ark. When Eli heard the Ark was captured, he fell over, broke his neck, and died. Hearing this news, his daughter-in-law named her baby "the glory has departed."<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical Question<br><br>The Philistines expressed their fear using a rhetorical question: "Who will protect us from the strength of this mighty God?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br>

1SA	4	2	c78l	translate-numbers		0	about four thousand men	Here the number four thousand is a round number. There may have been a few more than that or a few less than that. The word "about" shows that it is not an exact number. Alternate translation: "about 4,000 men" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
1SA	4	3	v2ec			0	the people	the soldiers who had been fighting the battle
1SA	4	3	d9z9			0	Why has Yahweh defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us bring ... enemies	The elders truly did not know why Yahweh had defeated them, but they wrongly thought they knew how to make sure it did not happen again, by bringing the ark to be with them.
1SA	4	4	s4ks	figs-explicit		0	who sits above the cherubim	You may need to make explicit that the cherubim are those on the lid of the ark of the covenant. The biblical writers often spoke of the ark of the covenant as if it were Yahweh's footstool upon which he rested his feet as he sat on his throne in heaven above. Alternate translation: "who sits on his throne above the cherubim on the ark of the covenant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1SA	4	4	vz4l			0	Phinehas	This Phinehas is not the same as the grandson of Aaron in Exodus and Numbers.

The second clause clearly refers to what the Philistines said to each other. The first clause probably refers to what they thought, though it could also refer to what they said to each other. If possible, avoid stating who was spoken to.
1SA	4	7	n37y	figs-pronouns		0	A god has come	The Philistines worshiped many gods, so they probably believed that one of those gods, or one whom they did not worship, had come into the camp. Another possible meaning is that they were speaking the proper name of the God of Israel: "Yahweh has come." Because 4:8 speaks of "gods," some translations read, "Gods have come," that is, "It is gods who have come." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])
1SA	4	8	xaq3	figs-rquestion		0	Who will protect us from the strength of these mighty gods?	This rhetorical question is an expression of deep fear. It can be written as a statement.

1SA	4	8	rx6y	figs-pronouns		0	these mighty gods ... the gods who attacked	Because the word "god" (or "God") in 4:7 is singular, many translations read "this mighty god ... the god who attacked," referring to any one of many possible gods, or "this mighty God ... the God who attacked," using the proper name of the God of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])
