REV	front	intro	xx8l			0		# Introduction to Revelation<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of Revelation<br><br>1. Opening (1:1-20)<br>1. Letters to the seven churches (2:1-3:22)<br>1. Vision of God in heaven, and a vision of the Lamb (4:1-11)<br>1. The seven seals (6:1-8:1)<br>1. The seven trumpets (8:2-13:18)<br>1. Worshipers of the Lamb, the martyrs, and the harvest of wrath (14:1-20)<br>1. The seven bowls (15:1-18:24)<br>1. Worship in heaven (19:1-10)<br>1. The Lamb's judgment, the destruction of the beast, the thousand years, the destruction of Satan, and the final judgment (20:11-15)<br>1. The new creation and the new Jerusalem (21:1-22:5)<br>1. Jesus' promise to return, the witness from the angels, John's closing words, Christ's message to his church, the invitation and the warning (22:6-21)<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Revelation?<br><br>The author identified himself as John. This was probably the Apostle John. He wrote the Book of Revelation while on the island of Patmos. The Romans exiled John there for teaching people about Jesus.<br><br>### What is the Book of Revelation about?<br><br>John wrote the Book of Revelation to encourage believers to remain faithful even when they are suffering. John described visions he had of Satan and his followers fighting against and killing believers. In the visions God causes many terrible things to happen on the earth to punish wicked people. In the end, Jesus defeats Satan and his followers. Then Jesus comforts those who were faithful. And the believers will live forever with God in the new heavens and earth.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by one of its traditional titles, "Revelation," "The Revelation of Jesus Christ," "The Revelation to Saint John," or "The Apocalypse of John." Or they may choose a possibly clearer title, such as "The Things that Jesus Christ Showed to John." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### What type of writing is the Book of Revelation?<br><br>John used a special style of writing to describe his visions. John described what he saw by using many symbols. This style of writing is called symbolic prophecy or apocalyptic literature. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### Are the events of Revelation past or future?<br><br>Since early Christian times, scholars have interpreted Revelation differently. Some scholars think John described events that happened during his time. Some scholars think John described events happening from his time until the return of Jesus. Other scholars think John described events that will happen in a short period of time just before Christ returns.<br><br>Translators will not need to decide how to interpret the book before they translate it. Translators should leave the prophecies in the tenses that are used in the ULT.<br><br>### Are there any other books in the Bible like Revelation?<br><br>No other book of the Bible is like the Book of Revelation. But, passages in Ezekiel, Zechariah, and especially Daniel are similar in content and style to Revelation. It may be beneficial to translate Revelation at the same time as Daniel since they have some imagery and style in common.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### Does one need to understand the Book of Revelation to translate it?<br><br>One does not need to understand all of the symbols in the Book of Revelation to translate it properly. Translators should not give possible meanings for the symbols or numbers in their translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])<br><br>### How are the ideas of "holy" and "sanctify" represented in Revelation in the ULT?<br><br>The scriptures use these words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating Revelation into English, the ULT uses the following principles:<br>* The meaning in two passages indicates moral holiness. Here, the ULT uses "holy." (See: 14:12; 22:11)<br>* Usually the meaning in Revelation indicates a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In these cases, the ULT uses "believer" or "believers." (See: 5:8; 8:3, 4; 11:18; 13:7; 16:6; 17:6; 18:20, 24; 19:8; 20:9)<br>* Sometimes the meaning implies the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULT uses "sanctify," "set apart," "dedicated to," or "reserved for."<br><br>The UST will often be helpful as translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions.<br><br>### Periods of time<br><br>John referred to various periods of time in Revelation. For example, there are many references to forty-two months, seven years, and three and a half days. Some scholars think these time periods are symbolic. Other scholars think these are actual time periods. The translator should treat these time periods as referencing actual periods of time. It is then up to the interpreter to determine their significance or what they may represent.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Revelation?<br><br>For the following verses, some modern versions of the Bible differ from older versions. The ULT text has the modern reading and puts the older reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider using the reading found in those versions. If not, translators are advised to follow the modern reading.<br><br>* "'I am the alpha and the omega,' says the Lord God, 'the one who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty'" (1:8). Some versions add the phrase "the Beginning and the End."<br>* "the elders prostrated themselves and worshiped" (5:14). Some older versions read, "the twenty-four elders prostrated themselves and worshiped the one who lives forever and ever."<br>* "so that a third of it [the earth] was burned up" (8:7). Some older versions do not include this phrase.<br>* "the one who is and who was" (11:17). Some versions add the phrase "and who is to come."<br>* "they are blameless" (14:5). Some versions add the phrase "before the throne of God" (14:5).<br>* "the one who is and who was, the Holy One" (16:5). Some older versions read, "O Lord, the One who is and who was and who is to be."<br>* "The nations will walk by the light of that city" (21:24). Some older versions read, "The nations that are saved will walk by the light of that city."<br>* "Blessed are those who wash their robes" (22:14). Some older versions read "Blessed are those who do his commandments."<br>* "God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city" (22:19). Some older versions read, "God will take away his share in the book of life and in the holy city."<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])<br>
REV	1	intro	u1e2			0		# Revelation 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter explains how the Book of Revelation records the vision John received on the island of Patmos.<br><br>Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page to make them easier to read. The ULT does this with the quoted words in verse 7.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Seven churches<br><br>John wrote this book to seven actual churches in Asia Minor, which is now the country of Turkey.<br><br>### White<br><br>The Bible often speaks of something that belongs to a person as being "white." This is metaphor and metonym for that person living rightly and pleasing God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>### "Him who is, and who was, and who is to come"<br><br>God exists now. He has always existed. He will always exist. Your language may have a different way of saying this.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Blood<br><br>Blood is a metonym for death. Jesus "has released us from our sins by his blood." John means that Jesus saved us from our sins by dying for us. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### "He is coming with the clouds"<br><br>Jesus went into the clouds when he went up to heaven after God raised him from the dead. When Jesus returns, he will also be "with the clouds." It is not clear whether he will be sitting or riding on clouds or coming in the clouds or "with the clouds" in some other way. Your translation should express this in a way that is natural in your language.<br><br>### "One like a son of man"<br><br>This refers to Jesus. You should translate the words "son of man" using the same words as you did in the Gospels for when Jesus called himself the "Son of Man."<br><br>### "The angels of the seven churches"<br><br>The word "angels" here can also mean "messengers." This might refer to heavenly beings, or to the messengers or leaders of these seven churches. John uses the same word "angel" (singular) in verse 1 and in many other places throughout the book. Your translation should also use the same word.<br>

This chapter begins to describe three "woes" announced at the end of Chapter 8.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Animal imagery<br>This chapter includes several animals: locusts, scorpions, horses, lions, and snakes. Animals convey different qualities or traits. For example, a lion is powerful and dangerous. Translators should use the same animals in their translation if possible. If the animal is unknown, one with similar qualities or traits should be used.<br><br>### Bottomless pit<br>This image is seen several times in the Book of Revelation. It is a picture of hell as being inescapable and the opposite direction as heaven. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/hell]])<br><br>### Abaddon and Apollyon<br><br>"Abaddon" is a Hebrew word. "Apollyon" is a Greek word. Both words mean "Destroyer." John used the sounds of the Hebrew word and wrote them with Greek letters. The ULT and UST write the sounds of both words with English letters. Translators are encouraged to transliterate these words using the letters of the target language. The original Greek readers would have understood "Apollyon" to mean "Destroyer." So translators may also supply what it means in the text or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])<br><br>### Repentance<br>Despite great signs, people are described as not repenting and so remain in their sin. People refusing to repent are also mentioned in Chapter 16.
