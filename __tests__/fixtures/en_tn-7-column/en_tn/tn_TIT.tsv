front:intro	m2jl				0	# Introduction to Titus\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the Book of Titus\n\n1. Paul instructs Titus to appoint godly leaders. (1:1-16)\n2. Paul instructs Titus to train people to live godly lives. (2:1-3:11)\n3. Paul ends by sharing some of his plans and sending greetings to various believers. (3:12-15)\n\n### Who wrote the Book of Titus?\n\nPaul wrote the Book of Titus. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.\n\n### What is the Book of Titus about?\n\nPaul wrote this letter to Titus, his fellow worker, who was leading the churches on the island of Crete. Paul instructed him about selecting church leaders. Paul also described how the believers should behave towards each other. He also encouraged them all to live in a way that pleases God.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Titus.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to Titus” or “A Letter to Titus”. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### In what roles can people serve within the church?\n\nThere are some teachings in the Book of Titus about whether a woman or divorced man can serve in positions of leadership within the church. Scholars disagree about the meaning of these teachings. Further study on these issues may be necessary before translating this book.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Singular and plural **you**\n\nIn this book, the word **I** refers to Paul. Also, the word **you** is almost always singular and refers to Titus. The exception to this is 3:15. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])\n\n### What is the meaning of **God our Savior**?\n\nThis is a common phrase in this letter. Paul meant to make the readers think about how God forgave them in Christ for sinning against him, and by forgiving them he saved them from being punished when he judges all people. A similar phrase in this letter is **our great God and Savior Jesus Christ**.
1:intro	c7me				0	# Titus 01 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nPaul formally introduces this letter in verses 1-4. Writers often began letters in this way in the ancient Near East.\n\nIn verses 6-9, Paul lists several qualities that a man must have if he is to be an elder in the church. (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns) Paul gives a similar list in 1 Timothy 3.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Elders\n\nThe church has used different titles for church leaders. Some titles include overseer, elder, pastor, and bishop.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Should, may, must\n\nThe ULT uses different words that indicate requirements or obligations. These verbs have different levels of force associated with them. The subtle differences may be difficult to translate. The UST translates these verbs in a more general way.
1:1	rtc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κατὰ πίστιν	1	**Faith** is an abstract noun. Here it refers to believing or trusting in Jesus.

1:4	gu55		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	γνησίῳ τέκνῳ	1	Though Titus was not Paul’s biological **son**, they share a common faith in Christ. Paul considers relationship to Christ through faith to be more important than biological relationship. Thus, because of their relative ages and shared faith in Christ, Paul considers Titus as his own son. It may also be that Paul led Titus to faith in Christ, and so Titus is like a son in this spiritual sense.

1:6	jen8			εἴ τίς ἐστιν ἀνέγκλητος	1	This is the beginning of the description of the character of an elder. Titus is to choose men who fit the following description.

(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1:8	vkq1			φιλάγαθον	1	“a person who loves to do good”
1:8	xy11		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	σώφρονα & ἐγκρατῆ	1	These two terms are very similar in meaning and may be translated by one term if the target language does not have two similar terms. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

1:9	pzi1			τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ τῇ ὑγιαινούσῃ	1	The Greek word rendered at **sound** normally refers to physical health. Paul speaks of this teaching as if it would cause those who believe it to be spiritually healthy, rather than spiritually sick.

1:13	je3r			ἵνα ὑγιαίνωσιν ἐν τῇ πίστει	1	See note on **sound** in [Titus 1:9](../01/09/pzi1). Alternate translation: “so they will have a healthy faith” or “so their faith may be true” or “so that they believe only what is true about God”

2:intro	h3il				0	# Titus 02 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Gender roles\n\nScholars are divided over how to understand this passage in its historical and cultural context. Some scholars believe men and women are perfectly equal in all things. Other scholars believe God created men and women to serve in distinctly different roles in marriage and the church. Translators should be careful not to let how they understand this issue affect how they translate this passage.\n\n### Slavery\n\nPaul does not write in this chapter about whether slavery is good or bad. Paul teaches slaves to faithfully serve their masters. He teaches all believers to be godly and live rightly in every situation.

2:2	xyz3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	πρεσβύτας & εἶναι	1	The Greek does not have **are**, but only **older men to be**. We need to supply a verb here, drawing from the idea of **speak** in the previous verse, such as **teach** or **exhort**. Alternate translation: “Teach older men to be” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
2:2	xy13		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	νηφαλίους & σεμνούς, σώφρονας	1	These three words are very close in meaning and may be combined into one or two terms if the target language does not have three separate terms. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

2:3	gl8e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	πρεσβύτιδας ὡσαύτως	1	The Greek does not have **are to be**, but only **older women likewise**.

2:3	abc4			καλοδιδασκάλους	1	The Greek word used here means “a teacher of what is good”.

In 2:7, Paul states the meaning negatively: **uncorrupted**, meaning, **without error**, and in 2:8 he states the meaning positively: **sound, whole**, meaning **correct**. Both terms refer to Titus’s teaching. Use either positive or negative terms in the target language, or use one term with this meaning in both places if it is difficult to use two terms.
2:8	xt6v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ἵνα ὁ ἐξ ἐναντίας ἐντραπῇ	1	This presents a hypothetical situation in which someone opposes Titus and then becomes ashamed for having done so.

2:9	ntp7			ἰδίοις δεσπόταις	1	“their own masters”
