## Facts: ##

In the Bible, the term \\"God\\" refers to the eternal being who created the universe out of nothing. God exists as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God's personal name is \\"Yahweh.\\"

* God has always existed; he existed before anything else existed, and he will continue to exist forever.
* He is the only true God and has authority over everything in the universe.
* God is perfectly righteous, infinitely wise, holy, sinless, just, merciful, and loving.
* He is a covenant-keeping God, who always fulfills his promises.
* People were created to worship God and he is the only one they should worship.
* God revealed his name as \\"Yahweh,\\" which means \\"he is\\" or \\"I am\\" or \\"the One who (always) exists.\\"
* The Bible also teaches about false \\"gods,\\" which are nonliving idols that people wrongly worship.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* Ways to translate \\"God\\" could include \\"Deity\\" or \\"Creator\\" or \\"Supreme Being.\\"
* Other ways to translate \\"God\\" could be \\"Supreme Creator\\" or \\"Infinite Sovereign Lord\\" or \\"Eternal Supreme Being.\\"
* Consider how God is referred to in a local or national language. There may also already be a word for \\"God\\" in the language being translated. If so, it is important to make sure that this word fits the characteristics of the one true God as described above.
* Many languages capitalize the first letter of the word for the one true God, to distinguish it from the word for a false god. 
* Another way to make this distinction would be to use different terms for \\"God\\" and \\"god.\\"
* The phrase \\"I will be their God and they will be my people\\" could also be translated as \\"I, God, will rule over these people and they will worship me.\\"
